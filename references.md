# Getting started

## Best reading /watching for the big picture (not necessarily in order):
- [Pretty Good substack articles](https://substack.com/@prettygoodproject),
- Custom NIPs, especially [Decentralized Lists](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzpef89h53f0fsza2ugwdc3e54nfpun5nxfqclpy79r6w8nxsk5yp0qyg8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytnhd9hx2qqnv3jkxetww3exzmrf0fjkgttvd9ehguc0w45dy)
- Say Wot, with Avi Burra, Vitor Pamplona, and Derek Ross, [S1 E1](https://podcasts.apple.com/py/podcast/say-wot-ep-1-user-driven-trust-scores-with-derek-ross/id1691033484?i=1000744974514)
- [Weaving the Fabric of Nostr](https://bitcoinpark.com/nostr-nights/david-strayhorn-weaving-the-fabric-of-nostr.html) -- talk at Nostr Nights, 2 Feb 2026

## Most relevant repos for apps:

Grapevine:
- [the prototype for Brainstorm: Grapevine](https://github.com/Pretty-Good-Freedom-Tech/brainstorm), implemented at [straycat.brainstorm.social](https://straycat.brainstorm.social), still live as of Feb 2026 but soon to be superceded by the NosFabrica rebuild

Concept Graph (aka Knowledge Graph):
- [brainstorm-knowledge-graph](https://github.com/wds4/brainstorm-knowledge-graph), implemented [here](https://brainstorm-knowledge-graph.vercel.app/#/dashboard) -- this implements Decentralied Lists, with plans to implement more of my custom NIPs; (began active development as of Feb 2026; what I'm building to serve Avi's TrustWave)

Grapevine + Knowledge Graph
- [Pretty Good](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good) on nostr; as of Feb 2026 this is 2 years old
- [Plex](https://github.com/wds4/plex) on IPFS, before I discovered nostr; in many ways this is the most complete implementation of the Concept Graph anywhere, more so than anything I've built on nostr (note: I have multiple versions of Plex in wds4, e.g. plex-builder14,  and I'm not 100 % sure which one is the most up to date)

Important high level concepts
- loose consensus
- class threads
- why GOFAI failed and how tapestry will fix it
